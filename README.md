This project aims to achieve secure and fast file sharing p2p in an innovative way through blockchain technology.

**SecureChain Project Overview**

SecureChain is a platform where users can save and share their files through blockchain with low gas fees. The saved files are encrypted and can only be accessed by private and public keys, making them more secure.

**Technology & Framework**

This project will be built on the Layer 1 ecosystems IPFS & Etherium. For UI/UX we utilize the most modern web frameworks like React.

**Features**

The users will be able to save their files through blockchain across multiple servers. They will be encrypted and distributed into multiple different servers. Because they are encrypted there won't be any privacy leakage and data retrieval will also become secure.

The web app will have a user-friendly UI that enhances user experience and satisfaction.

**Milestones**

As for now, we haven't added any interactive function to the web application. But there will be user accounts that are anonymous and a dashboard for files and other features.
